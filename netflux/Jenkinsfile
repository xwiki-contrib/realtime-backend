// It's assumed that Jenkins has been configured to implicitly load the vars/xwikiModule.groovy library which exposes
// the "xwikiModule" global function/DSL.
// Note that the version used is the one defined in Jenkins but it can be overridden as follows:
// @Library("XWiki@<branch, tag, sha1>") _
// See https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-global-lib-plugin for details.
